Puredata modular stuff

* Automatonism => A copy of the [upstream project](https://www.automatonism.com/) until the author begins to use revision control
* Illucia modular.pd => A modular synth with hardware control by a [DIY Illucia controller](http://www.illucia.com/)
* Dangerous delay => A prototype of a delay line with a pre-feedback send. Similar to the [Aleph Lines module](https://monome.org/docs/aleph/lines/).
* voltage-controller-sequencer.pd => A sequencer which runs at audio rate
* threshold-sequencer.pd => a sequencer that runs at message rate but does some unpredictable things
* euclid-sequencer.pd => a [Euclidian sequencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm) adapted from [Tim Vets](http://www.timvets.net/software/euclid.php?page=software)
* karplus-strong.pd => a [Karplus-Strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis) example adapted from [Tim Vets](http://www.timvets.net/video/puredata4.php?page=software)
* Throbbing Gristle Guy => A patch I built with Automatonism that reminds me of this Throbbing Gristle song titled [Discipline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOFv87DsqNs).
